# Gravity current solver implementation with OpenFOAM #

This is a repo for the gravityCurrentFoam model development and application. 

### Relevant information ###

* The solver solves the governing equations with the Boussinesq approximation. 
* Density change can be due to both sediment and salinity.
* OpenFOAM version: 2.3.x
